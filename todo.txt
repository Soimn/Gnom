safe_cast(type, var)        : Casts and asserts on over- / underflow
cast_to_common(var0, var1)  : Casts both to the width of the widest* param
static_if(expression)       : Compile time if statement

/* cast_to_common casting rules:
 ** * All integers(except U64) are upcast to the highest common width
** * When a U64 is cast in common with an unsigned int, both are cast to U64
** * When a U64 is cast in common with a signed int, both are cast safely to I64
** * When there is a float in the mix, both are cast to float

* Compile time and runtime type info
* Replacement for variadic functions
* Jai like for loops
